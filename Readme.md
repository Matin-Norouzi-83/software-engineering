# Software Engineering Internship Challenge – Fanap

This repository contains my solutions for the software engineering internship challenge.  
The challenge consists of several programming questions aimed at evaluating basic algorithmic skills, as well as optional data analysis and Git version control tasks.

## 🧪 Part 1: Mandatory Programming Questions

Each question has been implemented as a separate Python function with clear comments and examples.

1. **Reverse String**  
   Input: `"hello"` → Output: `"olleh"`

2. **Most Frequent Number**  
   Input: `[1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4]` → Output: `3`

3. **Prime Number Check**  
   Input: `7` → Output: `True`

4. **Matrix Diagonal Sum**  
   Input:  

[[9, 8, 7],
[6, 5, 4],
[3, 2, 1]]
Output: `15`

5. **Sort Words in a Sentence**  
Input: `"machine learning is fun"` → Output: `"fun is learning machine"`

All of the above are implemented in the file: `challenge.py`  
Or you can run them interactively in: `challenge.ipynb`

## ➕ Part 2: Optional Challenges

### 📊 CSV Sales Analysis

- A sample file `sales.csv` contains fictional daily sales records.
- The script `sales_analysis.py` calculates:
- Total sales
- Average sales amount
- Highest sales on a single day

### 🌐 Git & GitHub

This project is version-controlled using Git, and all changes are committed step-by-step.  
You're reading this on the main repository.
